# Examples #

Each example is taken from the test suite for `Tolc` and, given that you use the latest version, you can expect them all to work.

Each `C++` library named `MyLib` exports their functions and objects with a prefix of `MyLib`. In every test the library name is simply `m` for brevity. The examples that follow contains a bit of `C++` code, and the respective `Swift` code using it. Each `Swift` example is wrapped in the following boilerplate that is removed to make the examples more readable:

```objc
import m

assert(m.sayHello() == "Hello")
```
