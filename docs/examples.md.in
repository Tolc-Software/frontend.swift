# Examples #

Each example is taken from the test suite for `Tolc` and, given that you use the latest version, you can expect them all to work.

Each `C++` library named `MyLib` exports their functions and objects with a prefix of `MyLib`. In every test the library name is simply `m` for brevity. The examples that follow contains a bit of `C++` code, and the respective `Objective-C` and `Swift` code using it. Each `Objective-C` example is wrapped in the following boilerplate that is removed to make the examples more readable:

```objc
#include <m_objc.h>

int main() {
  @autoreleasepool {
    assert([m sayHello] == "Hello");
  }
}
```

And the same for `Swift`:

```swift
import m_swift

assert(m.sayHello() == "Hello")
```
